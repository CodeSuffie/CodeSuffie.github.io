            It is hard to describe what clogs are, especially since there is a consensus
            in the science community that they are ranked 3rd in the biggest mysteries ever, just after
            the identity of Jack the Ripper and where the holy grail is located. What we do know is that they
            are made from wood and happen to fit around adult feet, they are commonly found in the wild in
            the Netherlands, but have long been domesticated and shipped out to many countries. Many people
            visit the Netherlands to look at clogs in the wild, however this led to shops capturing clogs to set
            out in front of their shops so tourists could take pictures with them. Please do not feed into this
            predatory behaviour and make sure all clogs you visit in the Netherlands have a cage of at least
            200 square feet and are fed regularly.
